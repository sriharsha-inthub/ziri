# Ziri Documentation Index

Welcome! This repository organizes documentation by audience.

- **User Documentation** – `docs/user/`
  Guides for end‑users: installation, quick‑start, CLI reference, configuration, troubleshooting, usage examples, migration guide.

- **Developer Documentation** – `docs/developer/`
  Information for contributors and integrators: architecture, API reference, code examples, contribution guidelines, internal standards.

- **Deployment Documentation** – `docs/deployment/`
  Guides for ops and CI/CD: Docker setup, CI/CD pipelines, security considerations, migration, and other deployment‑related topics.

Each sub‑folder contains its own `README.md` that provides a brief overview and links to the detailed pages.

> **Note:** Internal development documentation lives under `internal/` and is not part of the user‑facing docs.
