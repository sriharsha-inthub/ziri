# Migration Guide (Thin Wrapper)

This file is intentionally minimal. The primary migration guide for users is located in the **User Documentation** section:

- ðŸ“„ **[User Migration Guide](../user/migration-guide.md)**

The deploymentâ€‘specific migration steps are identical to the user guide, so please refer to that document for the full details.
