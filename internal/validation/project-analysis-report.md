# Ziri Project Analysis Report

## Project Overview

**Ziri** is a high-performance AI code context CLI that transforms code repositories into searchable vector databases using semantic search capabilities. The tool provides enhanced context awareness by storing actual code snippets, metadata, and surrounding context rather than just file paths, making it a powerful assistant for developers working with large codebases.

### Target Audience
- **Primary Users**: Developers and engineers working with large codebases who need intelligent code search and understanding
- **Secondary Users**: Teams looking to integrate AI-powered code analysis into their development workflow
- **Enterprise Users**: Organizations seeking to improve developer productivity and code discovery

### Core Purpose
Ziri bridges the gap between traditional file search and AI-powered code understanding by providing:
1. **Semantic Code Search**: Find relevant code based on meaning, not just keywords
2. **Rich Context Results**: Actual code snippets with metadata instead of file paths
3. **AI Chat Integration**: Local AI assistance with codebase context
4. **Multi-Repository Management**: Organize and search across multiple codebases

## Current Features

- **Intelligent Batching**: Optimized API usage with adaptive batch sizing
- **Memory Management**: Handle large repositories without crashes
- **Caching System**: Embedding cache to avoid redundant API calls

### 4. Multi-Repository Management
- **Repository Isolation**: Per-repo vector stores with no cross-contamination
- **Set Organization**: Group repositories into logical sets for easier management
- **Scope Targeting**: Query specific repositories, sets, or all indexed code

### 5. Provider Flexibility
- **Ollama (Default)**: Local, free, no API keys required
- **OpenAI**: High-quality embeddings for production use
- **Hugging Face**: Research-focused models and customization
- **Cohere**: Alternative cloud provider with multilingual support

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **CLI Interface**: User-facing command routing and progress reporting

3. **Repository Parser**: File system operations with streaming and change detection
4. **Embedding Pipeline**: Concurrent embedding generation with intelligent batching
5. **Index Store**: Isolated, efficient storage for each repository
6. **Query Manager**: Search queries and result processing with rich formatting

### Storage Architecture
- **Repository Isolation**: Each repository gets its own isolated storage directory
- **Vector Storage**: FAISS-based high-performance vector database
- **Content Storage**: JSON metadata with actual code snippets and context
