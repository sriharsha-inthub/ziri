- **Formatted output** for different data types (bytes, duration, percentages)

Key Features:
- Animated progress bars with percentage completion
- Phase-aware progress reporting
- Detailed completion statistics with timing breakdown
- Error reporting with context and suggestions

### 3. StatisticsCollector (`lib/progress/statistics-collector.js`)

Key Features:
- File processing statistics (size, chunks, tokens)
- Embedding batch performance tracking
- API reliability metrics (success rate, retries, timeouts)
- Automated performance recommendations

### 4. ProgressManager (`lib/progress/progress-manager.js`)
- **Coordinated progress monitoring** across all components
- **Integrated reporting and statistics**
- **Scoped tracking** for specific operations
- **Event forwarding** and state management

Key Features:
- Single interface for all progress monitoring needs
- Automatic component coordination
- Export functionality for analysis
- Resource cleanup management

## Enhanced Features

### Real-time Progress Tracking
- **Live progress bars** with percentage completion
- **Throughput calculations** (files/sec, chunks/sec, embeddings/sec)
- **ETA estimation** based on recent performance
- **Phase-aware progress** (discovery, processing, embedding, storage)

### Comprehensive Statistics
- **File processing metrics**: total, processed, skipped, errors
- **Embedding performance**: batch sizes, response times, throughput
- **API reliability**: success rates, retry counts, timeout tracking
- **Memory usage**: peak and average consumption (optional)

### Performance Analysis
- **Timing breakdown** by phase and operation
- **Efficiency metrics**: batch efficiency, memory efficiency, retry rates

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```javascript
import { ProgressManager } from './lib/progress/progress-manager.js';

const manager = new ProgressManager({
  enableReporting: true,
  enableStatistics: true
});

manager.start({ repositoryName: 'my-project' });
manager.setPhase('processing');
manager.recordFileProcessing({ success: true, size: 1024, chunks: 5 });
const report = manager.complete();
```

### Advanced Configuration
```javascript
const manager = new ProgressManager({
  reportingOptions: {
    showProgressBar: true,
    showThroughput: true,
    showETA: true,
    progressBarWidth: 50
  },
  statisticsOptions: {
    trackMemoryUsage: true,
    trackApiMetrics: true,
    collectDetailedMetrics: true
  }
});
```

## Performance Impact
- **Minimal overhead**: Efficient event-driven architecture
- **Memory conscious**: Rolling windows for history data
- **Optional features**: Memory and detailed tracking can be disabled
- **Cleanup support**: Proper resource management and cleanup

## Future Enhancements
