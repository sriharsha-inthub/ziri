## Key Design Decisions

### Test Organization Strategy
- **Requirement-Based Structure**: Tests organized by requirement categories (1.x-8.x)
- **Integration Focus**: Emphasis on end-to-end workflows rather than unit tests
- **Performance Validation**: Dedicated performance regression testing
- **Real-World Scenarios**: Tests use realistic repository structures and sizes

### Test Data Management
- **Dynamic Repository Creation**: Helper functions create small, medium, and large test repositories
- **Isolated Test Environments**: Each test uses temporary directories for complete isolation
- **Realistic File Structures**: Test repositories mimic real JavaScript/Node.js projects
- **Configurable Complexity**: Repository size and complexity adjustable per test needs

### Performance Testing Approach
- **Baseline Establishment**: Performance baselines saved and compared across runs
- **Regression Detection**: Automatic detection of performance degradation (>20% slower)
- **Memory Monitoring**: Real-time memory usage tracking during tests
- **Throughput Validation**: Files/second and embeddings/second metrics

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Graceful Degradation**: Tests handle missing providers or configuration issues
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Error scenarios tested alongside success paths
- **Meaningful Messages**: Clear error reporting for debugging and troubleshooting
- **Recovery Testing**: Validation of system recovery from various failure modes
